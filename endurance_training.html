                There are 3
                types of cardio training: high-intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate-intensity steady state
                (MISS) and
                low-intensity steady state(LISS)

                        movements to
                        significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of one's maximum heart rate, followed by
