            <h3>Why is it so important to stretch daily?</h3>
            <p>
                Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a
                range of motions int the joints.

                    <td>It's a form of active stretching that is preformed by engaging the desired muscle's antagonist
                        through the joint's range of motion, only holding the stretch for 2-3 seconds The muscle is able
                        to increase in length without a reduction in muscle tension and therefore the individual is able
                        to improve their range of motion without a loss in force production.</td>

                    <td>Static stretching</td>
                    <td>This is the most commonly known style of stretching. It's a form of active or passive stretching
                        in which you hold a position for about 30-60 seconds, allowing the muscles and their connective
                        tissues to lengthen. But this type of stretching may not be the best way to improve performance
                        before physical activity, because it may inhibit the muscle's ability to fire properly.</td>

                    <td>Ballistic stretching</td>
                    <td>It utilizes muscle activation through quick, jerky movements. This inhibits the body's stretch
                        reflex and increase the muscle's range of motion through the force created by the bouncing. Most
                        fitness professionals do not recommend using this style, because the extra external force
                        produced can overload the muscle, increasing the risk for potential injury.</td>
