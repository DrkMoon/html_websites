        <h2>4 different types of workout</h2>
        <section id="endurance">
            <h3>Endurance training</h3>
            <p>
                Endurance exercise, also called cardio exercise, increases your heart and breathing rate. It improves
                the health of your lungs, heart, and
                circulatory system. It can help prevent diseases such as heart disease and even certain cancers. Cardio
                exercise can help you lose weight
                or maintain your body weight. Examples of aerobic exercises:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>running</li>
                <li>walking</li>
                <li>cycling</li>
                <li>swimming</li>
                <li>hiking</li>
                <li>jumping rope</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="strength">
            <h3>Strength training</h3>
            <p>
                Strength training is also called weight training, resistance training, and muscular training. It's the
                most popular type of training, especially in the gym.
                These types of exercises are movements designed to build muscle. Resistance training makes you stronger,
                burns calories, boosts your metabolism and mood, and improves
                the health of your heart and brain. It also decreases your risk of falls and injury, as you're better
                able to support your body. Here are some examples of exercises:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>weightlifting</li>
                <li>resistance band workouts</li>
                <li>push-ups variations</li>
                <li>squat variations</li>
                <li>bicep curls</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="flexibility">
            <h3>Flexibility training</h3>
            <p>
                Flexibility is incredibly important too, it's essential for avoiding injuries, particularly during
                endurance and strength training.
                The easiest way to improve your flexibility is by stretching. Stretching loosens up our muscles by
                elongating them, this is why it
                is important to stretch before and after a workout. Flexibility workouts help you improve your posture,
                prevent joint and muscle injuries
                prevent long-term pains and also lower your stress. Some examples of exercises:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>stretching</li>
                <li>yoga</li>
                <li>pilates</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="balance">
            <h3>Balance training</h3>
            <p>
                Balance is very important for all bodies, not just for athletes. Balance workouts help you increase
                stability, improve posture and agility, and prevent
                risk of falls and injuries. Examples of balance exercises:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>single-leg exercises</li>
                <li>yoga</li>
